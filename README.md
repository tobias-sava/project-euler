# Project Euler (First 100 Problems)

Project Euler is a series of problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. A typical problem might involve discovering patterns, optimizing algorithms, or implementing clever logic in code.

Each solution is organized by problem number and includes clear, well-explained and efficient code focused on both correctness and performance.

## Goals

- Strengthen algorithmic thinking
- Practice clean, efficient coding
- Explore the intersection of math and programming
